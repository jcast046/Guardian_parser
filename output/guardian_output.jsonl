    "incident_summary": "Codi was last seen asleep at the Buckroe Pointe town homes in the 100 block of Ranalet Drive in Hampton, Virginia at 2:00 a.m. on January 31, 2022. He lived with his father and three brothers, a five-year-old and two-year-old twins. His father, Cory Jamar Bigsby, said he woke up to find his son missing. He notified police at 9:00 a.m. that same day. A photo of Cory is posted with this case summary. In addition to his four children who lived with him on Ranalet Drive, he and his estranged wife have multiple older children living in the local area. Codi disappeared the same day the family was supposed to move to a new house. Authorities were immediately suspicious of Cory's story and believed Codi may not have disappeared at the time that his father claimed. On February 3, Cory was arrested for seven counts of felony child neglect. He admitted to leaving his children home alone on several occasions in December 2021 and January 2022 for hours at a time, with no way to contact him or emergency services. He said he did this because the children were \"too much of a handful\" and it didn't occur to him to get a babysitter. In July 2022, Cory was indicted for a further 23 charges: four counts of child abuse, two counts of child neglect in connection with the child abuse counts, fifteen counts of child neglect for leaving the children home alone, and two counts of child neglect for failure to secure medical attention for an injured child. None of the charges were connected to Codi's actual disappearance, only to Cory's alleged actions in the year prior to his son's disappearance. Cory is awaiting trial on these charges. If convicted, he could face a maximum term of 162 years in prison. Investigators stated his account of his son's disappearance did not match the evidence. His attorneys have claimed Cory was mistreated by the police and called the case a \"modern-day lynching.\" Cory was questioned between 9:30 p.m. on January 31 to 4:45 a.m. the next day, then he was taken to another room and isolated for eight hours. More than twenty times during the interview he said he was tired and wanted to go home, but he was told \"going home is not an option\" even though he was not under arrest at the time. Authorities also admitted that Cory had invoked his right to legal representation during the interview, twice, and that this was ignored. The detective was removed from the case and put on paid administrative leave as a result of the mishandled interrogation, and another detective was assigned to the case. It may be worth noting that there is a documented history of domestic violence between Cory and Codi's mother, Dina Abdul Kareem. He was charged with assaulting her in 2018 after she told police he had choked her, bitten her and threatened to kill her. https://charleyproject.org/case/codi-bigsby 5/9 9/9/25, 8:43 PM Codi Bigsby - The Charley Project The charges were dropped after Kareem stopped cooperating with the investigation and failed to appear for multiple court dates. She was investigated after Codi went missing and ruled out as a suspect in her son's case. In June 2023, Cory was charged with second-degree murder and concealment of a body in Codi's presumed death. Authorities stated they believed Codi was beaten to death by his father on June 18, 2021, six months prior to being reported missing, and that his body was buried in the state of Maryland. At Cory's trial in March 2024, Codi's brother, now seven years old, testified and said that as a four-year-old he had been unable to wake up Codi and his brother's face was bruised and red, and although Cory said Codi was fine, his brother thought Codi appeared to be dead. This was the last time he ever saw Codi. If the brother's memory is accurate and he was four years old when Codi disappeared, that would mean Codi was last seen sometime before December 24, 2021, the day his brother turned five. Kareem also testified, saying she had not been in a relationship with Cory since 2019. She said she left her children in Cory's care starting in 2020, after she was hospitalized. She stated Cory didn't initially want custody of Codi and called the child a \"mama's boy.\" Kareem testified the last time she saw any of her children prior to her disappearance was on November 1, 2020, and that Cory refused to give her his home address so she could visit them. She said she last spoke to Codi in April 2021, nine months before he was reported missing. That same month, Cory sent her an email saying, \"I need to bring Codi back to you, I don’t want to severely hurt him.\" He told her Codi had touched his younger brothers inappropriately, something Kareem did not believe. Cory maintained his innocence, but was convicted of both murder and concealment of a body. He faces up to 45 years in prison. He is still awaiting trial in the other offenses. The siblings Codi lived with at the time of his disappearance are now in foster care. Foul play is suspected in Codi's disappearance due to the circumstances involved.",

She has never been heard from again. Elsie was finishing her sophomore year at West Point High School when she went missing; she was an above-average student. At the time of her disappearance, she lived with her adoptive father on Fifth Street; her mother had died two years previously. Her father didn't realize she was missing for some time because he worked the night shift and arrived home during school hours, when Elsie would normally have been out of the house. He reported her missing three days after she was last seen. In 2015, nearly sixty years after Elsie's 1957 disappearance, authorities announced they have a suspect in her case. They haven't publicly identified the person, but they stated he was close to Elsie's age and is still alive; they've interviewed him multiple times. Elsie's father died in 1968, but her former classmates and the community would still like to determine her fate. Elsie's case remains unsolved."

    "incident_summary": "Katie was last seen at the home of a friend, Tammy Gates, in the 2700 block of McElroy Drive in Charlottesville, Virginia on July 12, 1982. She was spending the night with her Tammy; her own family lived in an apartment in the Four Seasons subdivision off Rio Road. Katie's friend's mother, Carrie Gates, called Katie's parents early that morning, thinking the girl had returned to her own apartment. https://charleyproject.org/case/katherine-sybil-worsky 3/7 9/9/25, 8:50 PM Katherine Sybil Worsky - The Charley Project She had not, however. Katie's parents notified police of her disappearance. Glenn Haslam Barker was one of the people who volunteered in the effort to search for Katie. A photograph of him is posted with this case summary. He had previously dated Carrie, but their relationship was over by July 1982. He was employed as a clerk at a gas station and convenience store which Katie's father frequently patronized. Authorities suspected Barker immediately in part due to his criminal record; he pleaded guilty to assault in 1981 after admitting to kidnapping teenage female acquaintance and holding her at knifepoint. Police interrogated him at Katie's disappearance. He admitted having seen her on the night she went missing. He stated he had come by the Gates home after everyone had gone to bed, and had given Katie and Tammy one can of beer each. Tammy said she and Katie had actually had more alcohol than that, and got sick afterwards. Afterwards, they went to bed. Barker stated he left at 12:30 a.m., after making sure Katie, Tammy and Tammy's younger brother were asleep. Tammy woke up at 5:30 a.m. and realized Katie was missing. Investigators did not believe Barker's story and, with his permission, searched his apartment in the Hessian Hills apartment complex on Georgetown Road. They found wet, bloodstained men's clothing and towels wedged between his mattress and box spring. Some of the blood was Type A, Barker's blood type, and some was Type B. Katie's blood was Type B; authorities discovered this fact by testing the menstrual blood on her bedsheets. Barker said he did not know how the clothes had gotten there. Authorities searched the residence a second time several days later and found a pair of girls' panties hidden in a rolled-up ball of socks in Barker's dresser. There was a tiny bloodstain in the back of the panties, consistent with the location where Katie injected her insulin. Barker was arrested and charged with Katie's murder in January 1983, six months after she went missing. Prosecutors theorized that after Katie became intoxicated, Barker carried her to the living room, attempted to molest her, then killed her. A few drops of Type B blood were found on the living room rug and coffee table. Barker maintained his innocence, stating he had had nothing to do with Katie's disappearance. https://charleyproject.org/case/katherine-sybil-worsky 4/7 9/9/25, 8:50 PM Katherine Sybil Worsky - The Charley Project The jury convicted Barker of second-degree murder and recommended a sentence of 18 years in prison, two years short of the maximum. They acquitted him of first-degree murder, meaning they did not believe Katie's murder was premeditated. He was only the second person to be convicted of murder in Virginia without the victim's body. Barker was paroled from prison in 1992. He was rearrested in 1993 and charged with possession of a firearm after a pellet gun was found in his car, and served a further six months in jail before being released again. Barker's name has been mentioned in connection with other homicides and missing persons cases and some theorize he was a serial murderer. He was never charged with any deaths besides Katie's, however, and maintained he he didn't harm Katie and the only wrongdoing he committed that night was giving her and Tammy beer when they were underage. Barker stated he believed he had been framed by the police, and accused them of planting the bloodstained clothing found in his apartment. He died of natural causes in North Carolina in 2014, at the age of 55. Katie's parents divorced after Barker's conviction. Her body has never been located, but foul play is strongly suspected in her disappearance due to the circumstances involved.",

    "incident_summary": "Khaleesi was last seen sometime in February 2021, but she was not reported missing until September. At the time of her disappearance, she was in the care of Candi Jo Royer and lived with her in Waynesboro, Virginia. Khaleesi's mother, Amanda G. Arey, had placed her daughter in Royer's care in October 2020, while Arey was incarcerated in the Middle River Regional Jail for parole violation. Royer was reported missing on September 3 and was believed to be with her boyfriend, Travis Brown, who had been a fugitive wanted by police in five different jurisdictions since August 21. He had fourteen charges against him, including strangulation, grand larceny, and assault and battery of a family member among other offenses. Photos of Royer and Brown are posted with this case summary. Police stated the pair had been going on a crime spree across Virginia and Pennsylvania since Royer went missing. When Arey found out Royer was missing, she told jail authorities that Royer had her child. By this time, Royer had stopped communicating with Arey in jail, and Arey hadn't heard from her or Brown in months and was concerned about her daughter's safety. Arey had been told that Royer placed Khaleesi with the child's maternal grandmother or aunt in the Covington, Virginia area, but this was untrue. Royer and Brown were located in Pennsylvania on September 12, and arrested. They had driven there in a stolen car and were hiding in a motel. They did not have Khaleesi and initially claimed workers with Shenandoah Valley Social Services had taken her, something Shenandoah Valley Social Services denied. Eventually Rowan said Khaleesi had died after accidentally striking her head, and he wrapped her body in a blanket and put it in the trash. Royer was charged with abuse/neglect of a child resulting in serious injury; Brown wasn't charged directly in Khaleesi's disappearance, but was held on other, unrelated charges. A little over a week later, police announced Khaleesi was dead, and had died while in the couple's care at Royer's home in the 200 block of Cattle Scales Road in Waynesboro around January 2021. https://charleyproject.org/case/khaleesi-hope-cuthriell 4/7 9/9/25, 8:43 PM Khaleesi Hope Cuthriell - The Charley Project A video taken of Khaleesi in January 2021 showed the child was covered with bruises, frail and unable to stand. Still photos of her taken around that time showed cuts and bruises on her face. Khaleesi's blood was found on the upstairs doorframes at Brown's home. Hair found in electrical tape wrapped around a bent wire hanger also matched Khaleesi's DNA. Brown made strange claims about the four-year-old to the police, stating she was suicidal and also sexually aware, and that she had once tried to choke his own daughter. In May 2022, Royer and Brown were indicted for Khaleesi's murder. Each was charged with aggravated murder, felony murder, unlawfully concealing a dead body, conspiracy to commit aggravated murder, conspiracy to commit child abuse, and conspiracy to concceal a dead body. Brown was also charged with child abuse/neglect resulting in serious injury. In August 2023, Brown was convicted of aggravated murder, felony murder and child abuse in Khaleesi's death, though his attorney tried to place the blame on Royer. At the trial, an expert on child abuse said how Khaleesi was treated \"fits the definition of child torture.\" Two weeks after Brown's conviction, Royer pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. The other charges against her were dropped. The pair have yet to be sentenced. Khaleesi's body has never been located, but foul play is suspected due to the circumstances involved. Investigators believe her remains are in a landfill which would potentially take years to thoroughly search.",

He was at home by himself that day, and when his father came home he was gone. There was no note, and he left all his belongings behind. He has never been heard from again. Authorities initially thought Quinn left of his own accord, and after he went missing they got tips that could be in the company of drug dealers in the Harlem, New York or Detroit, Michigan areas. However, he never resurfaced, and investigators stated they hadn't gotten any credible information in his case since the early 2000s. His case remains unsolved."

    "incident_summary": "Tammy and her friend, Angela Rader, were dropped off at William Ruffner Junior High School by one of the girls' relatives on February 7, 1977 in Roanoke, Virginia. The girls did not attend classes that day and were last seen hitchhiking in the city. Neither girl has been heard from again. Angela and Tammy had run away together several times before their disappearances in 1977. The police originally did not take their disappearances seriously as a result. Several months after their disappearances, one of the girls's mothers got a phone call from someone saying she was her daughter and was all right. Tammy and Angela were also allegedly seen in a grocery store in the months after they vanished but that sighting was never confirmed. The girls' mothers told authorities that Tammy and Angela worked for a friend of their families, Earl Conrad Bramblett, in 1977. A photo of Bramblett is posted with this case summary. Tammy's mother stated that her daughter was friends with Bramblett and his wife at the time, frequently spending time at their home. He did not seem to have any adult friends, just children. Investigators believe that Bramblett may have been involved in Tammy and Angela's disappearances. He reportedly told friends at a party in 1980 that he wished he did not \"hurt Tammy\" back in 1977. Bramblett was charged with molesting a ten-year-old girl in 1984 but acquitted. Tammy's older sister says he molested her when she was twelve years old and she believes he molested Tammy as well. Bramblett convicted of murdering a Virginia family of four, Blaine and Teresa Hodges and their two children, in 1994 and sentenced to death. He was living with the Hodges family at the time of their homicides. A jailhouse informant told police that Bramblett had told him that he killed the Hodges family after being caught molesting one of the children. The informant later recanted his statements, but Bramblett was executed in April 2003, still maintaining his innocence. It's worth noting that Bramblett has many supporters (particularly online) who believe he was wrongly accused. The same people maintain that both Tammy and Angela ran away from Roanoke voluntarily in 1977. https://charleyproject.org/case/tammy-lynn-akers 4/7 9/9/25, 8:51 PM Tammy Lynn Akers - The Charley Project Eight months after Bramblett was sent to death row, authorities dug up the yard of the house he had been living in when Tammy and Angela disappeared. They found nothing and the residence's current owners did not give them permission to search inside the house, so they never had the opportunity to look in the basement where they believe Tammy and Angela may be buried. Bramblett always maintained his innocence in the missing girls' cases. He said he was drunk when he made the statement about \"hurting Tammy\" in 1980 and his comment was misinterpreted. He said he believed Tammy died in a bonfire in central Florida in 1980 and the police know about it and have tried to cover it up. There is no evidence to support Bramblett's theory, however. Authorities never charged Bramblett in connection with the girls' disappearances. Angela's mother has since died; she believed her daughter was still alive. Tammy's family believes she is deceased and Bramblett was connected to her disappearance. Tammy's and Angela's cases remain open and unsolved.",

    "incident_summary": "Yuan was smuggled into Washington D.C. from China, via Bangkok and Paris, on August 25, 1998. She used a genuine Thai passport to get into the country and posed as the niece of her smuggler, Chaichana Klaharn, a Thai citizen. They were caught at Dulles International Airport. Yuan could not speak English or Thai. Through a Mandarin Chinese translator, she told immigration authorities she was from Fuzhou in the Chinese province of Fujian, and her parents had paid Klaharn a significant sum of money to take her to the United States. He said he was supposed to deliver Yuan to a hotel in Washington D.C. Klaharn pleaded guilty to passport fraud in September 1998 and was sentenced to four months in jail. Yuan was sent to live with a foster family in the 4700 block of Barnum Lane in Alexandria, Virginia, while authorities decided what to do with her. At first she stayed at home with a Mandarin-speaking babysitter. After three weeks she was enrolled in the seventh grade at Holmes Middle School, where she was the only Mandarin-speaking student. She would typically take the school bus home with one of her foster sisters, arriving home at 3:10 p.m. On the day of her disappearance, however, she took the bus home alone. Yuan was last seen exiting a Fairfax County school bus at approximately 3:00 p.m. on October 21, 1998. The bus was near Lincolnia Road and Deming Avenue in the Lincolnia area of Virginia at the time. She supposed to take a cab to a doctor's appointment at 3:30 p.m., but she wasn't there when the cab arrived and never showed up for her appointment. She never returned to her foster home and has not been heard from again. An extensive search of the area produced no clues as to Yuan's whereabouts. She was not familiar with the neighborhood at the time of her disappearance. Her foster family didn't speak Mandarin and, while they stated Yuan appeared to be intelligent and content with her situation, they admitted they didn't know her very well and couldn't guess whether she'd run away or not.

In November 2008, ten years after her disappearance, investigators said they thought Yuan could be in the Kansas City, Missouri area. This information was never confirmed, however. Police believe Yuan either ran away to avoid potential deportation to China, or she was abducted, possibly by one of the people who smuggled her into the country. If the latter is the case, Yuan may be being forced to work for her abductor(s). Her case remains unsolved.",
